0 stdin
1 stdout
2 stderr

0 -> read input
1 -> echo "output" -> output will be displayed
2 -> its error we are getting so below are the examples

$cat file.txt > out.txt
cat: file.txt: No such file or directory

Above error we are getting as stderr for which we are getting in terminal 
that can be redirect with below

[root@ansiblehost notes]# cat file.txt >> out.txt 2>&1
[root@ansiblehost notes]# cat out.txt
cat: file.txt: No such file or directory
[root@ansiblehost notes]# cat file.txt >> out.txt 2>&1
[root@ansiblehost notes]# cat out.txt
cat: file.txt: No such file or directory
cat: file.txt: No such file or directory
[root@ansiblehost notes]# cat file.txt > out.txt
cat: file.txt: No such file or directory
[root@ansiblehost notes]#

above example showing how it howing in terminal and 
when i keep 2>&1
indicates 2(stderr) which needs to > (redirect) to stdout (1) of same location (&1)

can also redirect to another path using below

[root@ansiblehost notes]# cat file.txt >> output.txt 2>> ./stderr.txt
[root@ansiblehost notes]# cat stderr.txt
cat: file.txt: No such file or directory
[root@ansiblehost notes]#
